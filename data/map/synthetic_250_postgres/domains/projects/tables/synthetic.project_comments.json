Each comment is uniquely identified by `comment_id` and may have a hierarchical structure indicated by `parent_comment_id`, linking comments to potential parent comments for threaded discussions. The foreign keys suggest a reference to undefined tables, possibly pointing to related project or task entities, highlighting its role in facilitating collaboration and communication within the larger project management schema.",
