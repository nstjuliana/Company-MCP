  "description": "The \"synthetic.benefits_plans\" table represents a catalog of benefits plans provided by an organization, detailing various plan options available for employees, including cost details and coverage specifics. The table plays a crucial role in managing and organizing benefit-related information, storing both employee and employer monthly contribution details, and allowing tracking of plan lifecycle through effective and termination dates. As it has no defined relationships with other tables, it appears to function independently within the data model, focusing on the standalone management of benefits information.",
