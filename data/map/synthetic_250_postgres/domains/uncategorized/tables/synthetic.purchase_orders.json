  "description": "The `synthetic.purchase_orders` table in the `synthetic_250_postgres` database represents a collection of purchase order records, likely to store details about orders made by a business for supplies or products. It holds primary significance as denoted by the primary key `po_id`, though the absence of column data limits precise identification of specific order attributes or transaction details. Despite having undefined foreign key relationships, it suggests intended dependencies on other tables, hinting at integration within a broader purchasing or procurement system, yet further information is needed for definitive detailing.",
