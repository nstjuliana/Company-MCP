Key details for each price book, such as its unique identifier (`price_book_id`), name, and status indicators (`is_active` and `is_standard`), are captured along with timestamps for creation and updates (`created_at` and `updated_at`). This table operates independently within the database, as it neither references nor is referenced by any other tables, implying it serves as a standalone component potentially for pricing management in the broader data model.",
