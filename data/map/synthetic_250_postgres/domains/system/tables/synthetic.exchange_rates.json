  "description": "The `synthetic.exchange_rates` table represents a collection of historical currency exchange rates between various currency pairs, identified by `rate_id` as the primary key. Each entry records the rate at which one currency (`from_currency`) was exchanged for another (`to_currency`) on a specific date (`rate_date`), along with the source of the exchange information. While the table lacks explicit foreign key relationships, its role in the data model appears to be storing exchange rate histories that could support financial analytic operations or currency conversion calculations.",
