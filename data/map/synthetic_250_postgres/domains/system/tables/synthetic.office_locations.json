It includes various attributes such as the physical address (with `address_line1`, `address_line2`, `city`, `state_province`, `postal_code`, `country_code`), the name of each location (`location_name`), time zone (`timezone`), and whether it serves as the headquarters (`is_headquarters`), along with timestamps for record creation and updates (`created_at`, `updated_at`).
