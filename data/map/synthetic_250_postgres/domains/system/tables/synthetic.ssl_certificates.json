The primary key is `cert_id`, and while there are no foreign key relationships, the table appears to track the lifecycle of SSL certificates, likely for managing web security compliance. The `server_id` suggests a linkage to server entities, although not explicitly connected through this schema, indicating the certificates' assignment to specific servers.",
