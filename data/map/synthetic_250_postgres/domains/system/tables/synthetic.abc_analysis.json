  "description": "The `synthetic.abc_analysis` table represents an ABC analysis of inventory in a business context, categorizing products based on their annual usage value and cumulative percentage. Each entry in the table is uniquely identified by `analysis_id` and includes attributes such as `product_id`, `warehouse_id`, and `classification` among others, highlighting the operational aspects of inventory classification. While it contains a foreign key relating to an undefined table, the absence of defined relationships or references suggests its use as a standalone analytical tool for assessing inventory value and performance.",
