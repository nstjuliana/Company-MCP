It records the originating entity (`entity_from`), the receiving entity (`entity_to`), associated general ledger account (`gl_account_id`), and timestamps for record maintenance (`created_at`, `updated_at`), with a boolean flag `is_active` indicating current activity status. Despite no explicit foreign key relationships defined, the table likely integrates with other financial records through `gl_account_id`, facilitating analysis of intercompany dealings within the synthetic business framework.",
