The table captures various attributes of a service request including descriptors like `title`, `description`, `category`, `priority`, and `status`, along with metadata such as `requested_by`, `assigned_to`, `fulfilled_at`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. As there are no foreign key relationships, this table functions independently within the database, likely serving as a record-keeping structure for service operations and their lifecycle statuses.",
