With no foreign key relationships or sample data available, the table appears to function as a standalone entity, potentially designed to manage or track time-related resources or events. Its role in the data model is isolated, suggesting it may serve either as a placeholder for integration with future tables or as an independent component in the synthetic dataset.",
