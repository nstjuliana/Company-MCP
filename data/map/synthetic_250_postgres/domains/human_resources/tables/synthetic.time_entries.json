Each entry is uniquely identified by `entry_id` and includes information on the task (`task_id`), the user performing it (`user_id`), as well as whether the time is billable and the relevant billing rate. The table tracks changes through timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) and seems to support billing processes by allowing the association of labor with specific tasks and users, although specific relationships to other tables are undefined.",
