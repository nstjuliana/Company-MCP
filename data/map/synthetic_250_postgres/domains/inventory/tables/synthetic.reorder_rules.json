  "description": "The `synthetic.reorder_rules` table defines parameters for restocking products, with each rule associated with a specific `product_id`, indicating when and how much to reorder based on `reorder_point`, `reorder_quantity`, `safety_stock`, and `max_stock` levels. The table captures the operational aspect of inventory management, although the relationship columns suggest it references another table which is not defined. The presence of columns like `lead_time_days`, `is_active`, and timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) further detail the mechanism and status of each reorder rule.",
