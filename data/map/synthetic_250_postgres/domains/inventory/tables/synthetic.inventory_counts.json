  "description": "The `synthetic.inventory_counts` table is designed to store information about inventory levels within a system; however, it currently does not contain any data. The table's primary key is `count_id`, which uniquely identifies each record, and it is set to reference another unspecified entity, suggesting its role in tracking inventory changes or audits related to that entity. Although precise inter-table relationships and the specifics of its columns are not provided, the table likely plays a critical role in maintaining inventory accountability within the broader synthetic database architecture.",
