Each claim, identified by a unique `claim_id`, is associated with a patient and an insurance provider, including details such as service date, submission date, charges, and payment status, reflecting the claim lifecycle from submission to resolution. While it hints at relationships with entities like `patient_id` and `insurance_id`, further links to their respective tables are needed to fully integrate this table into the broader healthcare records system.",
