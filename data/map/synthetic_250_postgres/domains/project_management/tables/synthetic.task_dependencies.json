The table captures the type and timing of dependencies using columns like \"dependency_type\" and \"lag_days\", with each dependency uniquely identified by the \"dependency_id\" primary key. Although the foreign key relationships are not explicitly defined, the presence of \"task_id\" and \"depends_on_task_id\" suggests that it plays a role in managing task order and scheduling within the broader task management data model.",
