Through the primary key `map_id`, it relates application identifiers (`app_id`) and server identifiers (`server_id`) alongside metadata such as `environment`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` timestamps, though it is unclear which specific table provides source references due to undefined foreign keys. Despite containing no data currently, it serves as a mapping table crucial for understanding the deployment of applications across various servers in different environments.",
