It stores detailed elements of each email template, such as the \"template_name\", \"subject\", and the contents in both HTML (\"html_content\") and plain text (\"text_content\") formats, alongside metadata like \"category\", \"is_active\" status, and timestamps for creation and updates. The absence of foreign key relationships indicates that the table functions independently within the database, primarily serving as a resource for other processes or systems that create or manage automated emails.",
