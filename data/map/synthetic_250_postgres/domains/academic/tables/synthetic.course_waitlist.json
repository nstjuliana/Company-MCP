  "description": "The `synthetic.course_waitlist` table likely represents a system to manage waitlists for courses, tracking individuals who wish to enroll once spots become available. It is identified by the primary key `waitlist_id` and maintains undefined foreign key relationships, suggesting it references other tables to link waitlisted entries to specific courses and possibly individuals, although the precise foreign keys are not specified. As the table holds no data (row count: 0) and lacks visible column definitions, it is assumed to serve as an integral yet currently unused part of a broader course enrollment management system.",
