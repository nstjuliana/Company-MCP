The table appears to store tasks of varying difficulty levels that involve financial calculations, as evidenced by the sample question about calculating fees in euros for a specific store and date. Given its standalone nature with no foreign key relationships, this table likely serves as a reference or configuration table for a task management or assessment system within the broader data model.",
