Each record captures whether an agent successfully completed a specific task (identified by TASK_ID) within a submission (SUBMISSION_ID), along with the difficulty level and the agent's response. The table serves as a fact table for tracking agent performance metrics, with no apparent relationships to other tables in the current schema.",
