Each submission is uniquely identified by a SUBMISSION_ID and links to a specific TASK_ID, with tracking information such as submission date, repository URL, and validation status. This table appears to serve as a central logging mechanism for agent-based task completion activities, possibly in an AI or automated system evaluation context.",
