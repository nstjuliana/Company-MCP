  "description": "The SYNTHETIC.ALERTS table represents a collection of alert records, each uniquely identified by the ALERT_ID as the primary key, detailing attributes like NAME and DESCRIPTION that define the alert's purpose and context. The table seemingly tracks various metrics and KPIs, indicated by columns like KPI_181_ATTR_1 and KPI_181_ATTR_3, which relate to dashboard, KPI, and report attributes, though it currently has no direct foreign key relationships with other tables, suggesting standalone functionality. It serves a role in storing and managing alert information within the data model, with potential insights for performance tracking or reporting, as evidenced by the sample data including dashboard and KPI attributes, along with a report-related date.",
