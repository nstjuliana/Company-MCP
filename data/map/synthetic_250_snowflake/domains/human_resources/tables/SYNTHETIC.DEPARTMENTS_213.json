  "description": "The SYNTHETIC.DEPARTMENTS_213 table represents departmental entities within the synthetic_250_snowflake database, identified uniquely by the DEPARTMENT_ID column. Lacking any foreign key constraints or references to other tables, it appears to function as a standalone component in the database, likely detailing attributes like NAME and DESCRIPTION along with various PATIENT, CLAIM, BILLING, and APPOINTMENT attributes for each department. The sample data suggests this table primarily governs descriptive and operational metadata for each department without directly interacting with other relational tables.",
