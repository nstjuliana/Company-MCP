  "description": "The SYNTHETIC.CONVERSIONS_139 table represents a business entity capturing conversion events, characterized by various attributes such as the conversion's name, descriptive details, associated campaign, and user email integration. It serves as a standalone dataset within the database, as it neither references nor is referenced by other tables, indicating an independent role in the data model for handling conversion-specific data. The table primarily facilitates tracking and recording of conversion events along with their creation timestamps, as evidenced by columns like \"CONVERSION_ID,\" \"NAME,\" \"DESCRIPTION,\" and \"CREATED_AT.\"",
