Each row captures details such as the lead’s name, description, event attributes, campaign attributes, update timestamp, and current status, with no direct relationships to other tables, indicating it’s a standalone entity in the data model. The presence of timestamp and status columns suggests the table helps track the lifecycle of a lead from creation through to its latest update.",
