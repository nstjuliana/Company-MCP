Without relationships to other tables, it serves as an isolated component within the data model, possibly acting as a foundational element for organizing dataset information and metrics attributes, such as KPI and visualization dates. The sample data indicates detailed logging of dataset-specific metrics and timestamps, underpinning its role in tracking dataset-related metadata.",
