  "description": "The SYNTHETIC.TICKETS table represents a business entity that manages ticketing information, tracking aspects such as subject, status, priority, and various escalation and knowledge attributes related to each ticket, identified uniquely by TICKET_ID. With no foreign key relationships, the table appears to function independently within the data model, focusing solely on maintaining detailed records of ticket-specific data indicated by column names and sample values like CREATED_DATE and ESCALATION_151_ATTR_0. Its role primarily involves storing and organizing operational ticket details for management purposes.",
