  "description": "This table stores a reference catalog of Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) used to classify different types of businesses and merchants, with each record containing a unique 4-digit MCC code, its corresponding category description, and creation timestamp. The table serves as a standalone lookup/reference table with no foreign key relationships, indicating it functions as a master data source for MCC classifications that would typically be referenced by transaction or merchant-related tables elsewhere in the system. Based on the sample data showing code \"1520\" for \"General Contractors - Residential and Commercial,\" this appears to follow standard industry MCC classification schemes used in payment processing and financial systems.",
