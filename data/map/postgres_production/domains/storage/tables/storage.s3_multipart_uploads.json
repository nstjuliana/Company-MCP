  "description": "This table appears to track S3 multipart upload operations within a storage system, managing the metadata and state of large file uploads that are split into multiple parts for efficient transfer. Based on its location in the storage schema and naming convention, it likely serves as a temporary tracking mechanism for in-progress multipart uploads to Amazon S3 or S3-compatible storage services. The table currently has no relationships to other tables and contains no data, suggesting it may be used for transient operational data that is cleaned up upon upload completion or failure.",
